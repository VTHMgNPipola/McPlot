# McPlot

McPlot is a plotting software, that will draw functions for you.

The aim of McPlot is creating a plotting software that is more
lightweight than GeoGebra, for example, since places like schools, that
benefit from this kind of software, don't have computers powerful enough
to run it at an acceptable performance.
